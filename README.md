Hello World!

## Open-source Scala projects

I have moved my open-source Scala projects to the **https://github.com/encalmo** organisation, which enables better collaboration and publishing. Please check there.

Some of the Scala projects are still waiting to be migrated:

- Tool to convert your project into a giter8 template (https://github.com/arturopala/make-it-g8)
- GitIgnore (https://github.com/arturopala/gitignore)
- Buffer[T] and Slice[T] (https://github.com/arturopala/buffer-and-slice)

## Other hobby projects

Here are a few of the repositories from my past I'm especially proud of:

- akka-io-sctp (https://github.com/arturopala/akka-io-sctp)
- elm-monocle (https://github.com/arturopala/elm-monocle)
- play-fsm (https://github.com/hmrc/play-fsm)
- encalmo (https://github.com/arturopala/encalmo)
